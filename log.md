**Currently Reading:** 
- A Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine

### Day 9: July 26 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Commit Express_Boilerplate a minimal boilerplate isn Expressjs and Jade.
- Pro Express.js by Azat Mardan

**Thoughts:** 
- Write code for yourself.
- Deplyment on [Now](https://zeit.co/now) is easy and unique.
- I am excited to work on more projects that consist of Nodejs and Expressjs. It's a good challenge to my current skills and I get to learn more. Expansion is essential.
- You have to choose between Anger or Tranquility of mind. It's your choice.
- Caffeine helps.

### Day 12: Aug 2

**Today's Progress**: 
- Learning & practice writing tests with framework Mocha and assertion libraries such as assert--node core module, and chai.
- Tried my hands on coffeescript
- Started playing around with Atom, adding snippets to avoid annoyance and boost productivity while working on projects.

**Thoughts:** 
- "The key is to write tests, even if they are terrible, horrible or awful, write them. You will get better as you go."
- CoffeScript is quite clean.
- Make snippets in Atom is super easy. You just have to add 'source file name' that is available in the language you want to make snippets for. Search in `Packages > language-*`. Looking forward to make snippets for Expressjs as I find lack of Expressjs snippets for Atom.

### Day 13: Aug 3

**Today's Progress**: 
- Published first Atom Package: [jade](https://atom.io/packages/jade) which contain snippets for the daily use working with Jade template engine.
- Working on second Atom Package which is a collection of snippets for Nodejs, JS with ES6 syntax support.
- Done with Second Atom Package: [atom-nodejs-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/atom-nodejs-snippets). Shipped.

**Thoughts:** 
- currently my mind is numb, haven't slept.

### Day 14: Aug 4

**Today's Progress**: 
- Done with two [FCC](https://freecodecamp.com) projects: [Random TrekQuote Machine](http://codepen.io/amanhimself/pen/GqYpRZ) & [Show Local Weather](http://codepen.io/amanhimself/pen/RRZaEY).
- Done with 3rd FCC Project: Wikipedia API Search with Random Article Button using Jquery, and AJAX call Wikipedia API. 

**Thoughts:** 
- Working with JQuery and [Open Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/current) was a learning. It's quite logical how things work when you are trying to hit api(s) for data and you should follow the flow, only then things will work.
